// Store is the storage SPI behind the generic queue engine. A backend that
// implements it gets polling, concurrency, lease heartbeats, retries and
// dead-lettering from the engine for free.
//
// Durations, never wall-clock instants, cross this interface: each store turns
// them into deadlines on its own clock. Shared backends use the database
// clock, which is what keeps leases correct when instances' clocks disagree.
//
// Every operation after Claim is fenced on Claimed.ClaimToken. When the lease
// behind a token has expired and the delivery was claimed again, operations
// with the old token change nothing and report it as not held.
