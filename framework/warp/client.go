// Warp calls the gateway's own Bifrost client in-process, not over HTTP.
//
// It used to run a private Bifrost instance whose one OpenAI-transport provider
// pointed at a base URL - by default this deployment's own /openai mount, as
// the browser saw it. That URL is the page origin, and a server behind
// Tailscale, a reverse proxy or split DNS frequently cannot reach its own public
// origin, so Warp failed on exactly the deployments least able to fix it with a
// setting. Calling the client directly has no address to get wrong.
//
// The full plugin pipeline still runs, deliberately: Warp's calls are logged
// (as app Warp, grouped by conversation), governed and priced like any other
// traffic, which is what the HTTP round trip gave the default setup too. The
// HTTP headers that used to carry Warp's per-call settings are set as the
// context values the HTTP transport would have derived from them - see
// warpInferenceContext.

// ResponsesExecutor is the narrow part of the gateway client Warp chats
// through. A function rather than *bifrost.Bifrost so tests can supply one
// without standing up a gateway, the same shape as EmbeddingExecutor.

// A model the operator typed provider-qualified ("vertex/gemini-2.5-pro") is
// routed by its own prefix, so the qualified form keeps meaning what it meant
// when it rode through the OpenAI-compatible mount. Only a known Bifrost
// provider counts as a prefix: native slugs such as "meta/llama-3-8b" carry a
// slash of their own and stay whole under the configured provider.

// An operator may configure a qualified name, but the model catalog keys on the
// bare one - so looking up "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5"
// matches nothing and the turn silently prices at zero, which is worse than no
// figure at all because it reads as free.

// ConversationHeader labels Warp's own model calls with the thread they

// The x-bf-lh- prefix is the logging plugin's own convention: everything after
// it becomes a metadata key on the log row, filterable through
// SearchFilters.MetadataFilters. A question that took five model calls would
// otherwise land as five unrelated rows with nothing tying them together. Warp
// makes no HTTP request, so this travels in the request-headers map the logging
// plugin reads, not on the wire.

// UserAgent labels Warp's traffic so the logs can tell it apart.
//
// Bifrost derives a log row's app from the User-Agent, so this is what turns
// Warp's own calls into a named client in the Logs view instead of an anonymous
// share of "API". It matters more here than for a normal integration: Warp reads
// the same table it writes to, and the indexer skips rows carrying it, so being
// able to see - and filter out - its own traffic is what keeps its answers about
// the deployment rather than about itself. Matched by schemas.Warp.

// calls run through the gateway like any other client's, so without a filter
// they would pick up every MCP server this deployment has configured for real
// end-user traffic - none of which Warp ever calls. Those tool declarations are
// not bounded the way Warp's own tool results and history are, and on a
// deployment with several MCP servers they can dwarf Warp's own ~10 tools by
// fifty times or more, resent on every iteration of the research loop - enough
// on its own to exceed a 200k-token context window on a single question. The
// value names no real MCP client, so the per-client match in core/mcp excludes
// every one of them; it narrows only Warp's calls.

// request. It rides as a plain value because the turn's context is a snapshot,
// not a BifrostContext: fasthttp recycles the request under it.
//
// A settler rather than one grant, because each model call of a turn is its
// own request. Governance resolves access once per grant and stamps the
// caller's name, teams and customer onto the context only while doing so; a
// grant shared across the turn was resolved on the first call, so every call
// after a tool result was logged with a bare user id and nothing above it.

// warpInferenceContext builds the context for one of Warp's model calls.

// Each value here is what the HTTP transport's context builder would have set

//
//   - request headers: User-Agent and the conversation label, which the logging
//     plugin reads only from this map (app detection and x-bf-lh- metadata).
//     The same map is presented to guardrail rules as `headers`, which the
//     guardrails HTTP pre-hook would otherwise have captured - without it a
//     rule conditioned on the User-Agent can neither target nor exempt Warp.
//   - session id (x-bf-session-id): a thread stays on one provider key, so
//     prompt caches and per-key rate-limit state survive between turns.
//   - api key id (x-bf-api-key-id): the key the settings pin, if any.
//   - MCP include clients (x-bf-mcp-include-clients): see excludeMCPToolsValue.
